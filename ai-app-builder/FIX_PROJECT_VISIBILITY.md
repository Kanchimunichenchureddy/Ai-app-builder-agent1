# Fix for Project Visibility Issue

## Problem
Projects created through the AI Builder are not visible in the Projects dashboard with proper details like code, view demo options, etc.

## Root Cause
The Builder page was using a simulated project creation process instead of calling the actual backend API to create and store projects in the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Builder.js
Modified the `handleCreateProject` function to properly call the backend API:
- Uses `aiChatService.generateCode()` to create projects through the backend
- Properly handles API responses and errors
- Maintains project creation progress tracking

### 2. Backend Integration
The backend API at `/builder/generate` properly:
- Creates project records in the database
- Generates project files and stores them
- Updates project status appropriately
- Returns project details for frontend display

### 3. Projects Dashboard
The Projects page now:
- Fetches real projects from the backend database
- Retrieves deployment URLs for deployed projects
- Shows "View Demo" button only when valid URLs exist
- Provides proper actions for each project

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Create a New Project
1. Navigate to the Builder page
2. Describe your project idea in the input field
3. Click "Build App" to start the creation process
4. Wait for the creation process to complete (all steps should show as completed)

### 2. Verify Project Visibility
1. Navigate to the "My Projects" page
2. You should see your newly created project in the list
3. Each project should display:
   - Project name and description
   - Project type and status
   - Creation and modification dates
   - Feature tags
   - Action buttons (View, Code, Deploy, Delete)

### 3. Deploy and View Demo
1. Click the "Deploy" button for your project
2. Select a deployment platform
3. Complete the deployment process
4. Return to the Projects page
5. You should now see a "View Demo" button for deployed projects
6. Clicking "View Demo" should open your live application

## Troubleshooting

### If Projects Still Don't Appear
1. Check that the backend service is running
2. Verify API connectivity with:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/projects/
   ```
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Ensure you're logged in with a valid user account

### If "View Demo" Button Doesn't Appear
1. Ensure the project has been successfully deployed
2. Check deployment logs for errors
3. Verify that deployment URLs are being generated and stored

## Technical Details

### Project Creation Flow
1. User describes project in Builder
2. AI analyzes requirements and generates specification
3. Backend API creates project record in database
4. Project files are generated and stored
5. Project appears in Projects dashboard
6. User can deploy project to generate live URL
7. "View Demo" button appears for deployed projects

### Data Flow
- Builder → Backend API (/builder/generate) → Database
- Projects Dashboard → Backend API (/projects/) → Database
- Deploy → Backend API (/deployment/) → Deployment Platform → Database

This fix ensures that projects created through the AI Builder are properly stored in the database and visible in the Projects dashboard with all the expected functionality.
