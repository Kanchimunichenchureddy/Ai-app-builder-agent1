## Technical Implementation

### Data Transformation
The project data transformation in the Dashboard component was enhanced to include all available fields:

```javascript
const transformedProjects = response.projects.map(project => ({
  id: project.id,
  name: project.name,
  description: project.description || 'No description provided',
  status: project.status || 'active',
  type: project.type || project.project_type || 'web_app',
  createdAt: project.created_at ? new Date(project.created_at).toLocaleDateString() : 'Unknown',
  lastModified: project.updated_at ? new Date(project.updated_at).toLocaleDateString() : project.created_at ? new Date(project.created_at).toLocaleDateString() : 'Unknown',
  framework: `${project.frontend_framework || 'React'} + ${project.backend_framework || 'FastAPI'}`,
  deployed: project.status === 'deployed',
  techStack: {
    frontend: project.frontend_framework || 'React',
    backend: project.backend_framework || 'FastAPI',
    database: project.database_type || 'MySQL'
  },
  features: project.features || ['User Authentication', 'Responsive Design'],
  integrations: project.integrations || [],
  config: project.config || {},
  previewUrl: null
}));
```

### UI Components
Enhanced UI components to display the additional information:
- Added description section in project modal
- Included project type in details grid
- Created separate sections for integrations and configuration
- Improved the visual hierarchy of information

## Benefits

3. **Enhanced Organization**: Project types and configurations help users organize and categorize their work
4. **Configuration Visibility**: Users can now see project-specific settings and integrations

## Testing

To verify the enhancements:
1. Create a new project using the AI Builder
2. Navigate to the Dashboard
3. View the project in both grid and list views
4. Click on a project to open the detailed modal
5. Verify that all project details are displayed correctly

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
