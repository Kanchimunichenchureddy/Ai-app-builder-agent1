# Frontend Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend was showing an eslint error:
```
ERROR
[eslint] 
src\pages\Dashboard.js
  Line 1748:20:  'FileText' is not defined  react/jsx-no-undef
```

## Root Cause
The `FileText` component from lucide-react was being used in the JSX but was not properly imported in the file. Although `FileText as FileDocument` was imported, the code was trying to use `FileText` directly.

## Fix Applied
1. **Added direct import for FileText**: 
   ```javascript
   import { FileText } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

2. **Removed the alias import** that was causing confusion:
   ```javascript
   // Removed: FileText as FileDocument
   ```

3. **Ensured consistent usage** of `FileText` throughout the component.

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Dashboard.js` - Fixed the import and usage of FileText component

## Verification
The error should now be resolved. The Dashboard component will properly render the FileText icons in the project details modal without any eslint errors.

## Additional Notes
This is a common issue in React development where components are used but not imported, or are imported with aliases that don't match their usage. Always ensure that:
1. All components used in JSX are properly imported
2. Import aliases match their usage in the code
3. Icons from external libraries like lucide-react are explicitly imported
